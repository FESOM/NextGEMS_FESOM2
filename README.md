# NextGEMS FESOM2 examples

This repository holds a collection of notebooks to plot FESOM and ICON ocean data (e.g. from the DYAMOND and NextGEMS projects) with minimal dependencies on installed packages.
Currently, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and xarray are enough for the examples. Click [here](https://github.com/koldunovn/FESOM2_data_processing/blob/main/easy_way_to_work_with_unstructured_grids_FESOM2_ICON.ipynb) to see how it works.
